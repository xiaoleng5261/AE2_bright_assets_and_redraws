# AE2_bright_assets_and_redraws
  This is a backport of highlight material assets from AppliedEnergistics2 and its accompanying modules, as well as a repaint of some material assets.
# Main changes: 
  1. The display components, upgrade card slots, and network tool card slot packages are no longer separated from the terminal.
  2. The network tool card slot package is adapted to the GUI of all work blocks as much as possible (a large number of texture packs have not completed this work).
  3. Redraw AE2Ad ditions material is a highlight style material.
  4. Adjust the GUI such as terminal slots to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
  5. Redraw the materials of some niche modules to make them more like bright-colored AE equipment.
  6. Draw a few items exclusive to the creative mode as dynamic materials.
  7. Modified the shortcut inventory style.
  8. Yes, this texture pack was born entirely for the aesthetic effect, so it does not fully comply with the painting rules and styles of AE2 highlight materials, but I tried my best to draw, it is a matter of ability.
